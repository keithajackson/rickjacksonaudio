          <h3>2013</h3>
          <p>Audio is such an important part of a player&apos;s experience. Rick has an excellent mind for advancing the technology of sound in games. He spearheaded systems that raised the bar for contextual audio and dialogue systems that were critical to the immersive player experience. Handling thousands of lines of dialogue, hours of sound FX and music, he allows his team to bring their own creative ideas to the table and always delivers on time. Rick's easy-going manner is a terrific balance for his passion for bringing game worlds to life.</p>

          <h3>2011</h3>
          <p>As a composer, I had the privilege of working with Rick on the game Transformers: Dark of the Moon. As audio director Rick’s musical direction, communication skills, and prompt feedback were superb. He was able to communicate his vision for the game’s soundtrack to me clearly from the beginning of the project through its completion. 
  Rick’s musical knowledge was very evident as we worked together, which is extremely helpful in guiding the creation of a soundtrack. Whenever I needed to contact Rick for additional clarification or feedback, he was always willing to take the time to communicate with me. 
  I wholeheartedly recommend Rick as an audio director. His audio expertise, musical knowledge, excellent communications skills, efficiency, and great attitude make him a strong asset to any audio team</p>

          <h3>2010</h3>
          <p>2K Sports employed Rick Jackson full-time as an Audio Director. For more than three years he managed our audio group with regard to all of our sports titles. This included everything from recording talent to managing schedules. 
  Rick is an intelligent and motivated individual. He is more than capable of managing a group of people. As Audio Director, Rick managed dialog writers, sound effects personnel, and audio engineers. With the help of his team, Rick produced high quality work for our sports titles given the incredibly short time-frame that he had to work. Rick worked diligently throughout and never complained about the difficult tasks he was given. In addition, he designed and managed the build-out of our audio studio here. Rick is quite resourceful and is even able to take on partially undefined tasks to completion. My time working with Rick was enjoyable and I wish him the best of luck in whatever he chooses to do. </p>

          <h3>2005</h3>
          <p>Rick is responsible and professional. He does what he says he is going to do. That's that, simple.
  At times I am amazed that Rick makes his milestones. Given that he usually doesn't get a build that he can work with until very late in the milestone I am always impressed that he delivers on his tasks (without complaining too!). Quality is never sacrificed.
  Regarding multitasking and prioritization, Rick is a super star in this area. What I find amazing is that he manages to not only keep himself on track with the tasks he has scheduled at the beginning of the month, but can seamlessly integrate new tasks which pop up during the milestone. All of this is done in the most calm manner possible.</p>

          <h3>2002</h3>
          <p>Rick has demonstrated that he will do whatever it takes to get the task completed. If he commits to something, we have a comfort factor that it will get done as promised. 
  Rick is a very easy going guy, easy to speak to and easy to communicate with. He seems to have absolutely no problem with accepting both criticism and feedback and has been wonderful to work with.
  The act of building a new studio and developing both music and SFX for two projects simultaneously with only one other person to help, this has been quite the daunting task. Add into this the problems with trying to complete our internal music and sound system across all platforms, and the fact that our music system still isn't done or functioning correctly, and I'd say he's done quite the exemplary job.</p>

          <h3>1999</h3>
          <p>Rick's technical knowledge combined with his musical skills make him one of the only people available to Interplay to do the console titles since a lot of technical knowledge is needed for those (dealing with weird file formats, driver level coding, etc ). He's also somebody to fall back onto for small, fast projects that need music (either composed or edited). He does these jobs well and on time, over and over again.
  He's also crucial in overseeing our interactive music parts (Klingon, SFC, etc) making sure it all works together, making it interactive, dealing with the composer at that level etc.</p>
